This project should contain everything you need to build and run HalfPint
under Xcode 5. If you run into any problems building or running, please file
a bug.

NOTE: HalfPint includes a copy of the OpenCV library built as an iOS
framework. OpenCV is licensed separately under similar terms. See the file
"OpenCV license.txt" for details. For more information on OpenCV (including full
source code to the library), see the [OpenCV website](http://opencv.org/).
